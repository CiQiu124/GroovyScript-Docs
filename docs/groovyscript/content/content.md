# Content

This part of GroovyScript allows the creation of game content like items and blocks. It's equivalent to ContentTweaker
for CraftTweaker, but for GroovyScript it doesn't require another mod.

!!! Note
    Requires version 0.4.0+. <br>
    Before you start adding content make sure to specify the pack name and id in
    your [runConfig](../../getting_started.md#run-config). <br>
    Also make sure to read [pack name and id](../../getting_started.md#pack-name-and-id)

Currently, GroovyScript adds helpers to create

- [items](item.md)
- blocks

Coming in the future:

- fluids
- Mekanism gases
